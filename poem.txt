The poem

< HERE STARTS THE POEM >

Roses are red, 

violets are blue.

Sugar is sweet

but not as sweet as you.

< STOP >

Roses are red,

violets are blue.

I hate poems

even more than I hate you.

< STOP >

Roses are red,

violets are blue.

I'm locked in the cellar

with pictures of you.

< THE END >
